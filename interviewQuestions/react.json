    "question": "What is React?",
    "answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its key feature is the ability to build components that manage their own state, which can be composed to create complex UIs.",

  {
    "question": "What are components in React?",
    "answer": "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. Components can be either class-based or functional, and they can manage their own state and lifecycle methods.",

    "question": "What is JSX?",
    "answer": "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which is then transformed into React elements. JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI and is commonly used in React components.",

  {
    "question": "What is state in React?",
    "answer": "State is a built-in object that allows components to create and manage their own data. When the state of a component changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state. State is typically used for data that changes over time, such as user input or fetched data.",

    "question": "What are props in React?",
    "answer": "Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to be passed down the component tree and can be used to customize the behavior or appearance of a component.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the virtual DOM?",
    "answer": "The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering performance. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then compares it with the actual DOM to determine the minimal number of changes needed. This process, known as reconciliation, helps improve performance by reducing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.",

  {
    "question": "What is a React hook?",
    "answer": "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow you to manage state, side effects, context, and more without needing to convert a functional component into a class component. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of useEffect in React?",
    "answer": "The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after the render phase and can be configured to run only when certain dependencies change, making it a powerful tool for managing side effects in React applications.",
